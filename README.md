# Prism

Headless web components for the Prism design system, built with [Lit](https://lit.dev).

Prism gives you behavior and nothing about how it looks. Each component handles
keyboard and focus, ARIA, and form participation, and is built on the native
element it stands for. You bring the design.

## Philosophy

- **Behavior is built in.** Keyboard support, focus, ARIA wiring and form
  participation work out of the box.
- **No visual opinions.** Components ship only the structural CSS they need to
  work. No colors, sizes, fonts or spacing.
- **Style from outside.** Reach inside with `::part()`, react to `:state()`,
  and tune the few structural knobs with CSS custom properties.
- **Many small components.** Each component does one job. Shared logic lives
  in private internals, never in one component that does everything.
- **Works anywhere.** Standard custom elements, usable from plain HTML or any
  framework.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add prism lit
```

`lit` is a peer dependency.

## Usage

Register the components you use. Class files have no side effects; the
`define` entry points register the tags.

```js
import 'prism/button/define';
import 'prism/text-field/define';
// or everything at once: import 'prism/define';
```

```html
<form>
  <prism-text-field label="Email" name="email" type="email" required>
    <span slot="description">We only use this for receipts.</span>
    <span slot="error">Enter an email address.</span>
  </prism-text-field>
  <prism-button type="submit">Save</prism-button>
</form>
```

```css
prism-button::part(base) {
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
  border: 1px solid currentcolor;
}

prism-button:state(disabled)::part(base) {
  opacity: 0.5;
}

prism-text-field:state(invalid)::part(input) {
  border-color: red;
}
```

To register under your own tag, import the class and define it yourself:

```js
import { PrismButton } from 'prism/button';
customElements.define('acme-button', class extends PrismButton {});
```
